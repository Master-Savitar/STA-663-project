# Tensor Completion Algorithm and its Application in Recommendation System

In this project, I implemented a modified Tucker Decomposition and solved the optimization through gradient descent.

I then defined a graph tensor to cast rating tensor completion tasks as link prediction on bipartite user-item interaction graphs, designed a novel-encoder framework incorporating representations learned from the Tucker Decomposition and harmonizing heterogenous information from different graphs basde on spatial GCN.

Finally, I introduced a bilinear decoder to predict links.
