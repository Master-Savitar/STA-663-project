# STA-663-project

This repository is created for STA 663 Python-implementated projects. The first one is a project comparing several recommendation algorithms' performance based on the Netflix dataset, which I accomplished during my undergraduate study. The second is my graduation project, in which I implemented a modified Tucker Decomposition regarding users' and items' side information, and incorporated the results as part of a multi-layer graph convolutional networks (GCN).
